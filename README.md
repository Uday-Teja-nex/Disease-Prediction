# Disease Prediction System Using ML Classifiers

## Overview
A comprehensive disease prediction system that utilizes multiple machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes) to predict diseases based on input symptoms. The system compares the performance of different algorithms and provides ensemble predictions for higher accuracy.

## Features
- **Multiple Classifier Implementation**:
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Ensemble Prediction**: Voting-based combination of multiple classifiers
- **Symptom-Based Analysis**: Processes multiple symptoms for accurate disease prediction
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- **Cross-Validation**: K-fold cross-validation for robust model evaluation
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly CLI/GUI for easy symptom input
